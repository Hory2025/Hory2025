## Hi there 👋

I'm Bence, a mechatronics engineer from Hungary.

I have an interest in creating electronic hardware and bring them alive with some low-level programming.
In my projects I use Python or C for programming and KiCAD for hardware design. 

🔭I’m currently working on building my portfolio, uploading my former projects
